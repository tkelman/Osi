\label{DylpStatistics}

\dylp will collect detailed statistics if the conditional compilation
symbol \pgmid{DYLP_STATISTICS} is defined.
The available statistics are described briefly in the paragraphs which
follow; for details on subfields, consult \coderef{dylp.h}{}.
Routines in the file \coderef{statistics.c}{} provide initialisation
(\pgmid{dy_initstats}), printing (\pgmid{dy_dumpstats}), and release of the
data structure (\pgmid{dy_freestats}).

\begin{codedoc}
  \item
  \Varhdr{angle}{max, min, hist}
  Statistics on the angles of inequality constraints to the objective function.
  For constraint $i$, this is calculated as
  $\displaystyle \frac{180}{\pi} \cos^{-1} \frac{a_i c}{\norm{a_i}\norm{c}}$.
  The maximum and minimum angle is recorded, and a histogram in
  $\degs{5}$ increments with a dedicated $\degs{90}$ bin.

  \item
  \Varhdr{cons}{sze, angle, actcnt, deactcnt, init, fin}
  Information about individual constraints: the angle of the constraint with
  the objective function, the number of times it's activated and deactivated,
  and booleans to indicate if the constraint is active in the initial and final
  active systems.

  \item\Varhdr{d2}{pivs, iters}
  Total pivot and iteration counts for \dylp.
  The pivot count is the number of successful simplex pivots.
  The iteration count also includes pivot attempts which did not succeed
  for some reason
  (\eg, a primal pivot in which the entering variable was eventually rejected
  because the pivot element was numerically unstable).

  \item\Varhdr{ddegen}{cnt, avgsiz, maxsiz, totpivs, avgpivs, maxpivs}
  Statistics on the amount of time spent in restricted subproblems trying to
  escape dual degeneracy.

  For each level (\ie, each nested level of restricted subproblem), \dylp
  records the number of times this level was reached, the average and maximum
  number of variables involved in a degeneracy, the total and average
  number of pivots executed at this level, and the maximum number of pivots
  executed in any one subproblem at this level.
  The array is generously sized (by compile time constant) to accommodate
  a maximum of 25 levels.

  \item\Varhdr{dmulti}%
	      {flippable, cnt, cands, promote, nontrivial, evals, flips,
	       pivrnks, maxrnk}
  Statistics on the behaviour of the generalised dual pivoting algorithm.
  Each call to \pgmid{dualmultiin} collects a list of candidate variables to
  enter the basis and sorts the list.
  This process may produce a unique candidate for entry, or it may leave a list
  of requiring further evaluation to determine the best sequence of flips and
  final pivot.

  The \pgmid{flippable} field records the number of flippable variables in the
  problem (\ie, variables with finite lower and upper bounds).
  The \pgmid{cnt} field records the total number of calls to
  \pgmid{dualmultiin}, and \pgmid{nontrivial} records the number of times
  the initial scan and sort did not identify a unique entering variable.

  The remaining fields, with one exception, are totals.
  They record the number of candidates queued for evaluation,
  the number of times that a sane pivot was promoted over an unstable pivot,
  the number of columns transformed ($B^{-1}a_k$) for evaluation,
  the number of bound-to-bound flips,
  the rank in the sorted list of the variable selected to
  enter, and the maximum rank for a variable selected to enter.


  \item\Varhdr{factor}{cnt, prevpiv, avgpivs, maxpivs}
  Statistics about basis factoring.
  The \pgmid{cnt} field records the total number of times the basis was
  refactored.
  The \pgmid{avgpivs} and \pgmid{maxpivs} fields record the average and maximum
  number of pivots between basis refactoring.

  \item\Varhdr{infeas}{prevpiv, maxcnt, totpivs, maxpivs, chgcnt1, chgcnt2}
  Statistics on the resolution of infeasibility during primal phase I.

  The maximum number of infeasible variables is recorded, as well as the total
  pivots in phase I and the maximum number of pivots with no change in the
  number of infeasible variables.
  \dylp also counts the number of times that the number of infeasible variables
  changed without requiring recalculation of the reduced costs
  (\pgmid{chgcnt1}), and the number of times when it did (\pgmid{chgcnt2}).
  Specifically, if exactly one variable gains feasibility, and it leaves the
  basis as it does so, the reduced costs do not have to be recalculated.

  \item\Varhdr{p1}{pivs, iters}
  Total pivot and iteration counts for primal phase~1 simplex.

  \item\Varhdr{p2}{pivs, iters}
  Total pivot and iteration counts for primal phase~2 simplex.

  \item\Varhdr{pdegen}{cnt, avgsiz, maxsiz, totpivs, avgpivs, maxpivs}
  Statistics on the amount of time spent in restricted subproblems trying to
  escape primal degeneracy.
  The content of individual fields is as for \pgmid{ddgen}.

  \item\Varhdr{pivrej}%
	      {max, mad, sing, pivtol_red, min_pivtol, puntcall, puntret}
  Statistics on the management of variables judged unsuitable for pivoting.
  Variables are queued on the rejected pivot list when a pivot attempt fails
  because the pivot element is numerically unstable or because the pivot
  produced a singular basis.
  During primal simplex, candidate entering variables are queued; during dual
  simplex, candidate leaving variables.

  The \pgmid{max} field records the maximum length of the rejected pivot list.
  The fields \pgmid{mad} and \pgmid{singular} record the number of variables
  queued for unstable pivots and singular basis, respectively.

  The \pgmid{puntcall} field records the number of times the routine
  \pgmid{dy_dealWithPunt} was called in an attempt to remove variables from the
  rejected pivot list.
  The \pgmid{pivtol_red} field records the number of times that the pivot
  selection multiplier was reduced in order to consider candidate variables
  previously rejected for numeric instability; \pgmid{min_pivtol} is the
  minimum multiplier value used.
  The \pgmid{puntret} field records the number of times \pgmid{dy_dealWithPunt}
  was unable to remove any candidates from the rejected pivot list and
  therefore recommended termination of the current simplex phase.

  \item\Varhdr{pmulti}{cnt, cands, nontrivial, promote}
  Statistics on the behaviour of the extended primal pivoting algorithm.
  Each call to \pgmid{primalmultiout} collects a list of candidate variables to
  leave the basis.
  This process may produce a unique candidate to leave, or it may leave a list
  of candidates requiring further evaluation to determine the final pivot.

  The \pgmid{cnt} field records the total number of calls to
  \pgmid{primalmultiout}, and \pgmid{nontrivial} records the number of times
  the initial scan did not identify a unique leaving variable.
  The \pgmid{promote} field records the number of times
  that a sane pivot was promoted over an unstable pivot,

  \item\Varhdr{tot}{pivs, iters}
  Total pivot and iteration counts for the call to \pgmid{dylp}.

  \item\Varhdr{vars}{sze, actcnt, deactcnt}
  Information about individual variables: the number of times a variable is
  activated and deactivated.
