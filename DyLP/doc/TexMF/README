  This TexMF directory tree contains various original and customised files
  used in the course of building dylp's documentation. Here's what you'll
  find:

  * Under bibtex, the bibliography file dylp.bib, and a slightly tweaked
    version of the plain bibliography style in louplain.bst.

  * Under fonts, a bevy of .tfm and .vf files.  As mentioned in the top-level
    README, I'm not a fan of Computer Modern and have gone to a fair bit of
    trouble to avoid using it. For text, this is relatively straightforward.
    For math, it takes real work.

    The .tfm and .vf files in this directory are all used in some way to
    avoid Computer Modern and make the result look decent in Bookman (with a
    selection of glyphs from other fonts thrown in on the math side). The
    .tfm files are used while LaTeX is typesetting.  The .vf files are used
    by dvips (and xdvi, if memory serves) to find the underlying glyph shapes.

    To regenerate these files (and the .fd files in the tex subtree) you
    should be comfortable with font manipulation and virtual font generation
    using fontinst. Email me (lou@cs.sfu.ca) and I'll forward the necessary
    sources and makefiles.

  * Under tex, there are a number of style files that I use and yet more font
    files --- .fd files that specify how LaTeX font directives should map to
    the underlying fonts.
