  This file contains instructions for building the DyLP documentation from
  source.

  Before you go further, ask yourself ``Do I really want to do this?'' If all
  you want to do is read the documentation, look at dylp.ps or dylp.pdf.
  There's a copy of each in this directory, in the build directory, and (if
  you've run `make install') installed in the COIN documentation directory.
  
  If you really want to build from source read on.

  You should be able to build the dylp documentation from source, in the build
  directory, by going to <builddir>/DyLP and typing `make doc'. There will
  follow a massive amount of output with all sorts of warnings (latex is run
  three times, bibtex once, and pdflatex once). Ultimately, it'll settle down
  and you should be left with dylp.dvi, dylp.ps, and dylp.pdf. The latter two
  come with the distribution, so dylp.dvi is the real sign of success.
  
  If that failed, well, read on further ...
  
  The dylp documentation makes heavy use of my highly customised local TeX
  environment. In particular, I don't like Computer Modern and have gone to
  great lengths to remove it.  I've tried to include all the necessary TeX
  style and font files (in the TexMF subdirectory) but expect problems.

  COIN distributions are set up so that they can be built in a build
  directory, distinct from the distribution directory. This is very useful
  for maintaining binaries for different environments, but not so critical
  for documentation. In any event, you should be working in the DyLP/doc
  directory in the build directory tree (the directory tree where you ran
  configure).

  LaTeX is not supported by Gnu autotools. In partial compensation, there is
  a script, build_dylpdoc, created in the build directory from
  build_dylpdoc.in when you ran configure. Build_dylpdoc will arrange for
  latex and bibtex to find inputs in this directory and subdirectories.
  It does this using hooks provided in the TeX Live distribution. (See, for
  example, http://tug.org/texlive/). I don't have access to other TeX
  distributions and cannot guarantee that these same hooks will work.

  Makefile_dylpdoc assumes that you have latex, pdflatex, dvips, and epstopdf
  (the latter to convert .eps files to .pdf files for figures). Replace with
  your local equivalent if necessary.

  Xdvi may have trouble locating the .vf (virtual font) files down in
  TexMF/fonts/vf. If your version of xdvi uses kpathsea as the underlying
  file search engine, try setting TEXMFHOME according to the value in
  build_dylpdoc. Otherwise, you're on your own.

  Build_dylpdoc will invoke make, using makefile.dylpdoc (created from
  makefile.dylpdoc.in during configure). Makefile.dylpdoc assumes that you're
  using Gnu make. If you're not, it will almost surely fail.

  The general sequence is to build the figures in Figures, then run latex,
  then run bibtex, then run latex two more times. By the end of all this, all
  references should be correctly resolved. This gets DVI output; to generate
  PDF output, a final run of pdflatex is executed.

  The figures in the dylp documentation were originally created with a
  proprietary program, IslandDraw from Island Graphics. For purposes of
  building the documentation, the source files are Figures/*.epsu. This is
  EPS pumped out by IslandDraw. It needs some cleanup; this is accomplished by
  the epsupatch.sed script. The result is a clean .eps file suitable for use by
  latex. The .eps files (and the .pdf versions required for PDF output) are
  placed in the Figures subdirectory in the build directory tree.
