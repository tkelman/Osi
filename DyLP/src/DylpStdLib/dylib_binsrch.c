int find (char *word, keytab_entry keytab[], int numkeys)     

/*
  Find looks up a word in a keyword table. It uses binary search and is
  insensitive to case.

  Parameters:
    word:	pointer to the word to be looked up
    keytab:	pointer to the array of keywords
    numkeys:	length of the keyword table

  Return value: 
    Normal     token number associated with the keyword
    Otherwise  -1 if the keyword cannot be found

int ambig (char *word, keytab_entry keytab[], int numkeys)

/*
  This routine looks up a word in a keyword table using a "shortest unique
  match" algorithm. If the minimum number of characters to be matched is
  greater than the length of the keyword, it's taken to be a request for an
  exact match (think of it as requiring the terminating '\0' to be matched).

  Parameters:
    word:	word to be looked up
    keytab:	array of keywords
    numkeys:	length of the keyword array

  Returns:
    Normal:	token number associated with the keyword
    Otherwise:	-1 if the keyword cannot be found
		-2 if the keyword is ambiguous
