/*
  The general strategy for setting up the COIN messaging facility is as
  follows:

    * Create a CoinMessages object, sized to accommodate the number of messages
      you plan to define. The initial size can be zero, but incremental growth
      is not particularly efficient.

    * Define your messages. There are three pieces of information that need
      to be supplied for each message: an external ID number, a level, and a
      format string. There is a notion of severity wired into the external ID
      number; see CoinMessageHandler for details. Level controls when the
      message is printed; CoinMessageHandler associates higher numbers with
      increased verbosity.  The format string can be null, if you want to
      build the whole thing on the fly.

      Severity, as of March, 2004:
	  0 - 2999	informational
       3000 - 5999	warnings
       6000 - 8999	non-fatal errors
       9000 -	 	fatal errors

    * Load the messages into the CoinMessage object. This involves repeated
      creation of a CoinOneMessage object, which is then loaded into the
      CoinMessages object using CoinMessages::addMessage. You specify an
      internal ID number at the time you add the message to the CoinMessages
      object.
    
      One approach to this is to define a derived class, XXXMessages, whose
      sole reason for existence is a constructor that performs the load. The
      internal ID numbers can be defined with an enum, which makes it a bit
      easier to specify a particular message and makes your code a bit more
      resilient against the inevitable insertion/deletion of messages as the
      code evolves.

    * Create a CoinMessageHandler object.

  To print a message, start construction of the message with

    CoinMessageHandler::message(<internal ID number>,<CoinMessages object>)
  
  Then use the various overloaded << operators to supply the necessary
  parameters. Finish with CoinMessageHandler::finish() or '<< CoinMessageEol'
  (where CoinMessageEol is part of the CoinMessageMarker enum).
*/

/*
  Message definitions.

  The precise form isn't important here, so long as the method that loads them
  into a CoinMessages object can come up with values for external number,
  detail level, and format string. The use of an enum to provide a local ID
  for each message is mainly useful with the internationalisation feature. It
  makes it easy to slap the same ID on alternate versions of a message.

  This function constructs a CoinMessage object filled with a default set of

  It is used to establish the initial set of messages, and is also called
  whenever the language is changed. The latter, because there's no way of
  guaranteeing that the sets of messages for alternate languages will all
  replace the same messages. This approach guarantees that the set of
  messages is always composed of the default language and the messages for
  one alternate language.
