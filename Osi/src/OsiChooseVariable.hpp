/** This class chooses a variable to branch on

    The base class just chooses the variable and direction without strong branching but it 
    has information which would normally be used by strong branching e.g. to re-enter
    having fixed a variable but using same candidates for strong branching.

    The flow is :
    a) initialize the process.  This clears all information.and sets state_ to 0
    b) if we are at state 0 then decide on strong branching list and set state to 1
    c) if state is 1 then do strong branching on list.  If list is empty then just
       choose aone candidate and return without strong branching.  If not empty then
       go through list and return best.  However we may find that the node is infeasible
       or that we can fix a variable.  If so we return and it is up to user to call
       again (after fixing a variable).
    d) when finished we clear the state
