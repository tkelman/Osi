\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Intro}

\dylp is a linear programming (LP) code designed to be used as the
underlying LP code in a branch-and-cut integer linear programming (IP) code.
It emphasises convenience of use by the client, particularly with
respect to fixing variables and adding and deleting constraints and
variables.
The target user population is IP algorithm developers; as such, \dylp
emphasises controllability and convenience over efficiency and is capable of
producing copious amounts of output for use in debugging.

\dylp implements a dynamic simplex algorithm
along the lines set out by Padberg in \cite[\S6.6]{Pad95}.
The core idea is that, at any given time, many of the constraints of a LP
problem are loose, and many nonbasic variables are unlikely to ever be
considered for pivoting because their reduced costs are very unfavourable.
A rough outline of the algorithm, neglecting unboundedness,
infeasibility, and implementation issues, is as follows.

From the problem supplied by the client, \dylp chooses an initial subset of
constraints and variables to become the active system.
This system is solved to optimality with primal simplex.
\dylp then enters a minor loop where it deactivates variables whose
reduced costs are worse than a threshold, 
activates variables whose reduced costs are favourable,
and reoptimises the system with primal simplex.
This minor loop is repeated until there are no more variables suitable for
entry.
Next, \dylp deactivates any loose constraints, activates
any constraints which are violated at the current basic solution,
and reoptimises with dual simplex.
On regaining feasibility, it returns to primal simplex and the
deactivate/activate variable loop.
When there are no variables with favourable reduced costs
among the inactive variables and no violated constraints
among the inactive constraints, the solution is optimal.

The primal simplex algorithm used by \dylp is a two-phase algorithm.
Phase I uses a dynamically modified objective to attain a primal feasible
solution.
Both phase I and phase II use a projected steepest edge (PSE) pricing
algorithm outlined by Forrest \& Goldfarb \cite[algorithm `dynamic']{For92}.
There are two antidegeneracy methods.
The first, referred to as `anti-degeneracy lite', attempts to resolve ties
among degenerate pivots by choosing the pivot in such a way as to make tight
a hyperplane which has a desirable alignment.
The second, applied when the first takes too long to resolve the degeneracy,
is a perturbation algorithm which
builds on a method described by Ryan \& Osborne \cite{Rya88}.

The dual simplex algorithm provides only a second phase with
dual steepest edge (DSE) pricing \cite[algorithm `steepest 1']{For92},
standard or generalised pivoting,
and an implementation of anti-degeneracy lite in the dual space.
In the context of \dylp, it is the subordinate simplex, used for
reoptimisation after adding constraints and as the initial simplex when the
problem is dual feasible but not primal feasible.

The active and inactive constraint systems are maintained with the \consys
subroutine library \cite{Haf98b}.
Basis factoring and pivoting are handled using the basis maintenance package
from \glpk \cite{GLPK,Mak01}.

\dylp is written in C and provides a native C interface.
It can be used as a standalone simplex LP code with only a minimal shell
required to generate the constraint system.

In the context of a branch-and-cut code, \dylp expects that the dominant
mode of use will be successive calls to
reoptimise a constraint system that is incrementally modified between calls.
On request, it will maintain its internal state (constraint system,
basis inverse, and support data structures) between calls to support
efficient hot starts for reoptimisation.
\dylp provides interface routines to support two queries commonly required in
a branch-and-cut context, pricing a new variable and pricing a dual pivot.
Because \dylp maintains this internal state, it does not provide a native
capability to interleave optimisation and reoptimisation of distinct
constraint systems.

\dylp can be used with \coin \cite{COIN} software through
the C++ \coderef{}{OsiDylp} OSI interface class.
An OSI interface object maintains a copy of the constraint system as
well as providing an interface to the underlying solver.
Multiple \pgmid{OsiDylp} objects with distinct constraint systems can exist
simultaneously and calls to optimise and reoptimise the systems can be
interleaved.
There is some loss of efficiency as the state of the underlying solver is
changed, but the necessary bookkeeping is handled by the \pgmid{OsiDylp}
objects.
