	Dylp: An implementation of the dynamic simplex algorithm

  Dylp is a linear programming solver, based on the dynamic simplex algorithm.
  Roughly, this means that dylp attempts to maintain an active constraint
  system which consists of only those constraints and variables that are
  relevant at the current extreme point. The bet is that this will be a
  useful property in situations where the same constraint system is
  repeatedly modified and reoptimised (e.g., in a branch-cut-price MIP
  code).  You can also tell dylp to operate with the full constraint system,
  which is useful for obtaining an initial solution.

  Dylp is built to be a research and development code. It can produce a range
  of statistics, and it can tell you more about how it's solving your problem
  than most people will ever want to know. It also includes extensive cross
  checks to catch errors during program development.

  Dylp development takes place in a Sun Solaris/Workshop programming
  environment, most recently Solaris 9 and Forte Developer 7 C/C++ 5.4.  It
  is also tested in a Linux environment, most recently SuSE Linux 9.0 and GCC
  3.3.1. COIN-OR places some importance on Windows compatibility, and if you
  can build COIN at all, then dylp should run. If it doesn't, please say
  something. Generally speaking, if your computing environment supports IEEE
  floating point then it should be possible to port dylp with very little
  effort.

  Web pages: 

   Eh, what to say here. COIN has a lot of infrastructure just coming on line,
   and I'm just getting the hang of it. Here's a selection of resources, which
   will improve as I get time to tweak them:
   
   http://www.coin-or.org/projects.html#dylp	The dylp paragraph on the
					COIN-OR projects page.
   http://www.coin-or.org/svn/DyLP	Dylp's subversion repository. Check
					out the Trunk directory.
   http://projects.coin-or.org/DyLP	Dylp's Trac page. Pretty raw at this
					point. Please submit bugs here. Also
					a decent browsing interface to the
					subversion repository.
   http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~lou/OsiDylp	The pre-COIN web page.


  Mailing list:
   
   http://list.coin-or.org/mailman/listinfo/coin-discuss	The main COIN
					mailing list. Probably as good a place
					as any for comments until the volume
					gets large enough to justify a dylp
					list.
