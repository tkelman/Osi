	Dylp: An implementation of the dynamic simplex algorithm

  Dylp is a linear programming solver, based on the dynamic simplex algorithm.
  Roughly, this means that dylp attempts to maintain an active constraint
  system which consists of only those constraints and variables that are
  relevant at the current extreme point. The bet is that this will be a
  useful property in situations where the same constraint system is
  repeatedly modified and reoptimised (e.g., in a branch-cut-price MIP
  code).  You can also tell dylp to operate with the full constraint system,
  which is useful for obtaining an initial solution.

  Dylp is built to be a research and development code. It can produce a range
  of statistics, and it can tell you more about how it's solving your problem
  than most people will ever want to know. It also includes extensive cross
  checks to catch errors during program development.

  Dylp development takes place in a Sun Solaris/Workshop programming
  environment, most recently Solaris 10 and Sun Studio 12 (cc 5.9).  It is
  also tested in Linux and Windows environments.  COIN-OR places some
  importance on Windows compatibility, and if you can build COIN at all, then
  dylp should run. If it doesn't, please report the problem by filing a
  ticket at https://projects.coin-or.org/DyLP/

  Generally speaking, if your computing environment supports IEEE floating
  point then it should be possible to port dylp with very little effort.

  Web pages: 

   Eh, what to say here. COIN is still settling into its infrastructure, so
   this may be out-of-date by the time you read it. But, if you've managed to
   acquire the code, you're probably over that already.

   Here's a selection of resources:
   
   http://www.coin-or.org/projects	The main COIN-OR projects page.
   
   https://projects.coin-or.org/DyLP	Dylp's Trac page. From here, you can
					read about dylp, browse the code, and
					file tickets for bug reports.

  SVN repository:

  https://www.coin-or.org/svn/DyLP/trunk	development branch
  https://www.coin-or.org/svn/DyLP/stable	stable branches
  https://www.coin-or.org/svn/DyLP/releases	releases
 
  The releases are frozen snapshots of the corresponding stable branches.
  Stable branches get bug fixes, which eventually trigger a new release. Unless
  you have some good reason to do otherwise, pick the highest numbered stable
  branch or release.

  If you're using DyLP via the OsiDylp interface, you probably want to monitor
  the Osi mailing list.
